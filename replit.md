# Central dos Desmanches

A marketplace/leads platform connecting accredited vehicle dismantling facilities (ferro-velhos) with customers, workshops, and other dismantling businesses for automotive, nautical, and aeronautic parts.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript, Vite 7, Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query, wouter routing
- **Backend**: Express.js 5 + TypeScript (tsx in dev), JWT auth, WebSockets (ws), multer (file uploads)
- **Database**: SQLite via Drizzle ORM (better-sqlite3)
- **Monorepo layout**: `client/` (frontend), `server/` (backend), `shared/` (shared schemas/types)

## Running the App

The Express server serves both the API and the Vite dev client on **port 5000** via a single process.

```bash
npm run dev       # Development (tsx server/index.ts)
npm run build     # Production build (esbuild + Vite)
npm start         # Run production build
```

## Multi-Item Order Architecture

Orders are "carts" — each order contains one or more `order_items`, where each item can be for a different vehicle type. Key principles:
- Each `order_item` routes independently to matching desmanches based on its `vehicleType`
- Proposals, negotiations, and images attach to the `order_item` (via `orderItemId` FK), not just the order
- Items have their own `status` lifecycle: open → has_proposals → negotiating → closed/completed/cancelled/expired
- In `DesmancheOrdersTab`, orders are flattened to individual items and filtered by desmanche's `vehicleTypes`
- `CreateOrderWizard` lets clients add multiple items (different vehicles/parts) in one request

## Database Tables
